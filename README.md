# Machine Learning Exercises
In this repository I will document my solutions and conclusions to the exercises and topics presented in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, Copyright 2023 Aurélien Géron, ISBN 978-1-098-12597-4.

The official Github repository of the mentioned book can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3).

By creating various mini projects I intend to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and also contribute to the huge knowledge database aka the internet and maybe someone someday will find this usefull.
