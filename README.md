# Machine Learning Exercises
In this repository I will document my solutions and conclusions to the exercises and topics presented in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, Copyright 2023 Aurélien Géron, ISBN 978-1-098-12597-4.

The official Github repository of the mentioned book can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3).

By creating various mini projects I intend to deepen my knowledge of machine learning and also contribute to the huge knowledge database aka the internet and maybe someone someday will find this usefull.

# Python environement

To make this repository easy to use, there is an environement.yml file that can be loaded with [conda]() with with the following command when in the directory of this repository:

'''
conda env create -f environment.yml
'''

To activate the environement, run the following command:

'''
conda activate machine-learning-eldeskar
'''

To update the environement, run the following command:

'''
conda env update -f environment.yml
'''

## Spam filter

To create a spam filter various free datasets are available:

[The Spambase dataset from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase)
[The SMS Spam dataset from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
[The SpamAssassin dataset](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/)
[The Enron Spam dataset](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/)

# Glossary

Training set - Examples used to train the model
Training instance -  A single example and a subset of the training set
Model - Learns and makes prediction based on input values
